# CNN Based CT GAN

The GAN network definitions and training functions are in the file Copy_of_CT_Generator_based_on_CNN_GAN.ipynb.
Some of the model training output is also included here, but not all of it as the file got too long for GIThub to allow me to upload.

The metrics and code to generate sample images are in the file CT_Generator_based_GAN_Results.ipynb
Outputs are not included as the file was too large with all of the images included.
